Needed to be done:

1. New wn30.turtle was provided: need to replace the one in the
   triple-store (context <file://wnlite.nt>

   # First, execute the following SPARQL:

   # drop graph <file://wnlite.nt>

   Next, import wn30.turtle from the openWordnet-PT project and make
   sure to use the same context as above (file://wnlite.nt).

2. We need to clean the literals of the synsetId and tagCount
   properties (they need to be xsd:nonnegativeInteger).

   # Run: (FIX-INCORRECTLY-TYPED-LITERALS) on file CLEAN-UP.LISP

3. We need to clean all IRIs that have illegal characters in them.  We
   should make them only in the standard ASCII values: a-zA-Z0-9.

   # Still need to implement that one.

4. Re-export the files own-pt.nt.gz and wordnet-en.nt.gz

Done:
