Convert RDF from OWN-PT to LMF, using the mapping from PWN 3.0 synset
ids to ILI obtained from:

https://github.com/globalwordnet/ili/blob/master/ili-map.ttl

You need mlisp to run:

(load "/usr/local/agraph-client/agraph")
(load "own-lmf.lisp")
(in-package :own-lmf)
(open-triple-store "wn30")
(fill-data)
(output-lmf)
(close-triple-store)

output will be placed at own-pt.xml
