Convert RDF from OWN-PT to LMF, using the mapping from PWN 3.0 synset
ids to ILI obtained from:

https://github.com/globalwordnet/ili/blob/master/ili-map.ttl (938052bc8447940408a3885aa5652b41cae930ac)

The mapping was converted to CSV and the AdjectiveSatelliteSynset with
suffix -s were converted to -a to comply with our own naming convention.

What we need:

- mlisp (Franz Common Lisp)

- Allegro Graph (Franz Triple Store)

- Lisp packages: all lisp packages that we use are available in
  quicklisp except `agclient`. You need to clone the repo
  https://github.com/own-pt/agclient in your
  `quicklisp/local-projects/`.

You need mlisp to run:

(load "own-lmf.lisp")
(in-package :own-pt-lmf)
(open-triple-store "wn30")
(fill-data)
(output-lmf)
(close-triple-store)

output will be placed at own-pt.xml

To verify it, use https://github.com/jmccrae/gwn-scala-api

and:

./gwn -v -i own-pt.xml -f WNLMF

Output should be something like:

|       | Lang | Words     | Synsets   |
|:------|:----:|:---------:|:---------:|
| ownpt |  pt  |     55143 |    117659 |
