Convert RDF from OWN-PT to LMF, using the mapping from PWN 3.0 synset
ids to ILI obtained from:

https://github.com/globalwordnet/ili/blob/master/ili-map.ttl

You need mlisp to run:

(load "/usr/local/agraph-client/agraph") ;; replace with the path of your local agraph client installation
(load "own-lmf.lisp")
(in-package :own-lmf)
(open-triple-store "wn30")
(fill-data)
(output-lmf)
(close-triple-store)

output will be placed at own-pt.xml

To verify it, use https://github.com/jmccrae/gwn-scala-api

and:

./gwn -v -i own-pt.xml -f WNLMF

Output should be something like:

Validation successful
|       | Lang | Words     | Synsets   |
|:------|:----:|:---------:|:---------:|
| ownpt |  pt  |     55143 |    117659 |
